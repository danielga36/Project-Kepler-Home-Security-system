# Project Kepler Home Security System 🏠🔒

Welcome to the **Project Kepler Home Security System**! This project utilizes Arduino and nRF24L01 modules to create a wireless mesh network for home security.

## 📋 Description
This system uses **nRF24L01 modules** to establish a wireless mesh network between Arduino boards. It provides a secure method for detecting and alerting intrusions in a home environment through wireless communication.

## 🚀 Features
- **Wireless Mesh Network**: Reliable communication between multiple Arduino nodes.
- **Intrusion Detection**: Trigger alerts using push buttons and sensors.
- **Alert System**: Activates buzzer and sends SMS notifications.

## ⚙️ Hardware Required
- **nRF24L01 Modules** (transmitter and receiver)
- **Arduino Leonardo** and **Arduino Nano**
- **Push Button** (for triggering events)
- **Buzzer** (for audio alerts)
- **GSM Module (SIM800L)** (for sending SMS)
- **LCD Display** (for status updates)

## 📦 Libraries Used
- [RF24](https://github.com/nRF24/RF24)
- [RF24Network](https://github.com/nRF24/RF24Network)
- [Wire](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Wire)
- [LiquidCrystal_I2C](https://github.com/fdebrabander/Arduino-LiquidCrystal-I2C-library)
- [DS3231](https://github.com/JChristensen/DS3231)

## 🔧 Setup
1. **Hardware Setup**: Connect the nRF24L01 modules to the Arduinos as specified in the code. Wire up the buzzer, GSM module, and LCD display.
2. **Software Setup**: Upload the provided code to both Arduino boards. Adjust the network addresses and other configurations as needed.

## 🛠️ Code Overview
The code handles:
- **Transmitter**: Sends data from a push button to the receiver node.
- **Receiver**: Receives data, updates the LCD display, triggers alerts, and sends SMS notifications.

## 📝 Notes
- Ensure all components are properly connected and powered.
- Customize SMS recipient numbers and alert settings in the code.
